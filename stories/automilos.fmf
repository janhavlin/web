    As AutoMilo≈° I want to execute relevant tests when the issue is switched to given state

description:
    Test/plan run on AutoMilos should be triggered when the issue is switched to given state.
    The trigger should be done via the trigger-url provided in the JIRA issue. There could be the standard url for the
    service used by AutoMilos with the additional query parameters specific to AutoMilos needs. The url should have all
    the needed info to run the test/plan/test and plan in Testing farm.

example:
  - |
    trigger-url: https://tmt.org/?url=https://github.com/teemtee/tmt&name=/tests/smoke&plan-name=/plans/features/core
